# Interactive-Data-Visualization-Dashboard
This project involves creating an interactive data visualization dashboard using Python for data analysis and Flask for web development. The dashboard will allow users to explore and visualize datasets interactively.


Project: Interactive Data Visualization Dashboard
Description:
This project involves creating an interactive data visualization dashboard using Python for data analysis and Flask for web development. The dashboard will allow users to explore and visualize datasets interactively.

Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
Flask (Python web framework)
HTML, CSS (for frontend)
JavaScript (optional, for enhancing interactivity)
Project Structure:

data_analysis.py: Python script for data preprocessing and analysis.
app.py: Flask application for web development.
templates/: HTML templates for rendering web pages.
static/: Static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript) for frontend.




Run the Project:

Make sure you have Python and Flask installed.
Place your dataset (e.g., data.csv) in the project directory.
Run python app.py to start the Flask server.
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to view the dashboard.
This project provides a basic structure for integrating data science with web development, allowing users to explore datasets interactively through a web-based dashboard. You can further enhance the project by adding more data analysis features, interactive visualizations, and improving the frontend design.
